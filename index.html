                        had glowing feedback from all stakeholders.

                        conducting performance reviews.
                        - Provided leadership through accountability and professionalism.
                        - Liaised with regional managers, producing updates and translating key strategies into actions.

                        with the new titles and reading avidly and broadly across genres (approximately 70 books a
                        year).
